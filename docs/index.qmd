This is a collection of write ups on how to solve the various problems presented by [Github user](https://janismac.github.io/ControlChallenges/) "Janismac".

## What do I need?

### Software

-   A real OS like Linux or Windows. [^index-1]

-   The [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/install/)
